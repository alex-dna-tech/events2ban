# Overview  
wail2ban.ps1 is a PowerShell-based security automation tool designed to enhance Windows system protection against brute-force attacks and unauthorized access attempts. It monitors Windows event logs for suspicious activity, identifies offending IP addresses, and temporarily bans them using Windows Firewall rules. This tool is particularly valuable for system administrators and IT security professionals seeking lightweight, configurable, and automated intrusion prevention on Windows environments.

# Core Features  
- **Event Monitoring**  
  Monitors Application, Security, and System logs for specific event IDs that indicate failed login attempts or other suspicious behavior.  
  _Why it's important_: Enables real-time detection of potential threats.  
  _How it works_: Uses PowerShell to query event logs and filter entries based on configurable criteria.

- **IP Detection and Banning**  
  Extracts IP addresses from event messages and bans them after a configurable threshold of failed attempts within a set time window.  
  _Why it's important_: Prevents repeated unauthorized access attempts from the same source.  
  _How it works_: Parses event messages, tracks IPs, and applies Windows Firewall rules.

- **Ban Management**  
  Allows users to list currently banned IPs, release specific IPs, or clear all bans.  
  _Why it's important_: Provides control and flexibility in managing bans.  
  _How it works_: Maintains a ban list and interfaces with firewall rules to manage entries.

- **Logging**  
  Logs all actions taken, including bans and releases, for audit and review.  
  _Why it's important_: Ensures transparency and traceability of security actions.  
  _How it works_: Writes structured logs to a file with timestamps and action details.

# User Experience  
- **User Personas**  
  - System Administrators managing Windows servers  
  - IT Security Analysts monitoring internal threats  
  - Power users securing personal or small business systems

- **Key User Flows**  
  1. Configure event IDs and thresholds in the script or config file  
  2. Run the script with administrative privileges  
  3. Monitor logs and firewall actions  
  4. Manage bans via command-line options or GUI (future enhancement)

- **UI/UX Considerations**  
  - Clear and concise command-line output  
  - Optional GUI for configuration and ban management  
  - Help documentation embedded in the script  
  - Config file with comments and examples for ease of setup

# Technical Architecture  
- **System Components**  
  - PowerShell script (`wail2ban.ps1`)  
  - Windows Firewall via PowerShell  
  - Event Log subsystem  
  - Configuration at the begining of file via powershell variables
  - Log events for audit trail

- **Data Models**  
  - IP tracking dictionary with timestamps and attempt counts  
  - Ban list with metadata (ban time, reason)  
  - Whitelist with static and dynamic entries

- **APIs and Integrations**  
  - Windows Event Log API via PowerShell  
  - Windows Firewall via PowerShell  

- **Infrastructure Requirements**  
  - Windows OS (Windows 10/11, Server 2016+)  
  - PowerShell 5.1+  
  - Admin privileges  
  - Enabled and accessible event logs  
  - Functional `netsh`, `wmic`, `ipconfig` commands

# Development Roadmap  
- **MVP Requirements**  
  - Core event monitoring and IP banning  
  - Basic configuration via script variables  
  - Ban management commands  
  - Logging of actions  
  - Execution policy and admin privilege checks  
  - Basic whitelist support

- **Future Enhancements**  
  - Advanced error handling and logging  
  - Performance optimization for log parsing  
  - Compatibility layer for different Windows/PowerShell versions  
  - Security checks to prevent banning critical IPs  
  - Expanded help documentation and usage examples
  - Powershell script that creates Windows schedule task (optional)

# Logical Dependency Chain  
1. **Foundation**  
   - Event log access and parsing  
   - IP extraction and tracking  
   - Firewall rule application  
2. **Usable Front End**  
   - Command-line interface with clear output  
   - Logging and ban management  
3. **Buildable Features**  
   - Config file support  
   - Whitelisting logic  
   - Error handling improvements  
   - Compatibility and performance tuning

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Technical Challenges**  
  - Parsing inconsistencies across event log formats  
    → Mitigation: Use robust regex and fallback logic  
  - Firewall rule conflicts or failures  
    → Mitigation: Validate rules before applying and log errors

- **MVP Definition**  
  - Over-scoping early features  
    → Mitigation: Focus on core detection and banning first

- **Resource Constraints**  
  - Limited testing environments  
    → Mitigation: Use virtual machines with varied OS versions

# Appendix  
- **Research Findings**  
  - Similar tools like Fail2Ban on Linux  
  - Windows Event ID documentation  
  - PowerShell execution policy best practices

- **Technical Specifications**  
  - Event IDs to monitor (e.g., 4625 for failed logon)  
  - Regex patterns for IP extraction  
  - Firewall rule syntax for banning IPs  
  - Log format: `[Timestamp] Action: IP - Reason`
