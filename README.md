# Wail2ban

![Saddest Whale](http://i.imgur.com/NVlsY.png "Saddest Whale")

wail2ban is a Windows port of the basic functionality of [fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/), inspired by elements of [ts_block](https://github.com/EvanAnderson/ts_block).

## Overview

wail2ban monitors Windows Event Logs for failed login attempts from specified event IDs. When multiple failed attempts originate from the same IP within a configurable time window, it automatically creates temporary Windows Firewall rules to block further access from those IPs.

## Installation
To install wail2ban:

1. Download or copy the `wail2ban.ps1` script to any folder.
2. Run it with the `-install` parameter.

## Prerequisites

The script checks for and requires:

- Administrative privileges (must be run as administrator)
- PowerShell version 5.1 or higher
- PowerShell execution policy set to 'RemoteSigned' or less restrictive

## Security Considerations

#### Avoid Storing Plain-Text Passwords and API Keys

When using features in `report.ps1`, it is strongly recommended to use encrypted files for credentials and API keys instead of passing them in plain text.

**For Email Reporting:**
You can create an encrypted credential file using the `-GenMailCred` parameter.
You can then use `C:\secure\mail_creds.xml` with the `-MailCred` parameter.

**For AbuseIPDB Reporting:**
You can create an encrypted API key file using the `-GenAbuseIPDBKey` parameter.
You can then use `C:\secure\abuseipdb.xml` with the `-AbuseIPDBKeyPath` parameter.

## Usage

### wail2ban.ps1

- To list current banned IPs:
  ```powershell
  .\wail2ban.ps1 -ListBans
  ```

- To unban a specific IP:
  ```powershell
  .\wail2ban.ps1 -UnbanIP "X.X.X.X"
  ```

- To unban all IPs:
  ```powershell
  .\wail2ban.ps1 -ClearAllBans
  ```

- To run the script silently (no console messages):
  ```powershell
  .\wail2ban.ps1 -Silent
  ```

- To install the scheduled task to run at startup:
  ```powershell
  .\wail2ban.ps1 -install
  ```

- To uninstall the scheduled task:
  ```powershell
  .\wail2ban.ps1 -uninstall
  ```

### report.ps1

- To generate an HTML report of recent activity:
  ```powershell
  .\report.ps1
  ```

- To create an encrypted credential file for sending emails:
  ```powershell
  .\report.ps1 -GenMailCred "C:\secure\wail2ban_creds.xml"
  ```

- To generate and email a report using a credential file:
  ```powershell
  .\report.ps1 -Mail -SmtpServer "smtp.example.com" -From "sender@example.com" -To "recipient@example.com" -MailCred "C:\secure\wail2ban_creds.xml"
  ```

- To create an encrypted AbuseIPDB API key file:
  ```powershell
  .\report.ps1 -GenAbuseIPDBKey "C:\secure\abuseipdb.xml"
  ```

- To report recently banned IPs to AbuseIPDB:
  ```powershell
  .\report.ps1 -AbuseIPDBReport -AbuseIPDBKeyPath "C:\secure\abuseipdb.xml" -AbuseIPDBCategories "18,22"
  ```

- `-To <string[]>`: The recipient's email address(es). Required if `-Mail` is specified.
- `-MailCred <string>`: Path to the credential file for SMTP authentication. Required if `-Mail` is specified.
- `-GenMailCred <string>`: If specified, prompts for SMTP credentials and saves them to the given path, then exits.
- `-InstallMailReportTask`: Installs the scheduled task for the HTML report.
- `-AbuseIPDBReport`: If specified, reports banned IPs from the last 24 hours to AbuseIPDB.
- `-AbuseIPDBKeyPath <string>`: Path to the AbuseIPDB API key file. Required if `-AbuseIPDBReport` is specified.
- `-GenAbuseIPDBKey <string>`: If specified, prompts for an AbuseIPDB API key and saves it to the given path, then exits.
- `-AbuseIPDBCategories <string[]>`: Comma-separated list of AbuseIPDB categories to use for reporting. Required if `-AbuseIPDBReport` is specified.
- `-InstallAbuseIPDBTask`: Installs the scheduled task for daily AbuseIPDB reporting.

## Functional Overview

- Monitors specified event logs for certain Event IDs related to failed login attempts.
- Tracks attempts from each IP address within a configurable time window (`$CheckWindow` seconds).
- If an IP exceeds the attempt threshold (`$CheckCount`) within the window, it is banned:
  - Adds a firewall rule with a name prefixed by `$FirewallRulePrefix`.
  - The ban duration scales exponentially based on previous bans, with a maximum cap (`$MaxBanDuration` seconds).
- Bans are automatically revoked after their expiry time, and rules are removed.
- Supports whitelists for IPs that should never be banned.
- Keeps the state of bans in a JSON file to allow persistence across runs.
- Provides CLI commands to list, unban, or clear bans.
- Generates HTML reports summarizing the bans and IP statistics.

## Limitations & Notes

- This script is intended for use on Windows systems where PowerShell 5.1+ and Windows Firewall are available.
- The system needs to be run with administrator privileges.
- The script relies on specific event IDs and log types; adjust the `$EventsToTrack` hashtable for your environment.
- Ban durations are exponential but capped to avoid excessively long bans.
- It does not run as a persistent service but can be scheduled to run at startup or on an interval.

## Additional

You can extend or customize the script by tweaking:

- `$EventsToTrack`: To monitor different logs or event IDs.
- `$Whitelist`: To prevent banning certain IPs.
- `$CheckWindow` and `$CheckCount`: To customize detection sensitivity.
- The firewall rule naming conventions in `$FirewallRulePrefix`.

> [!NOTE] 
> The script logs significant actions and errors, which can be retrieved by examining Windows Event Logs under the "Application" log with source "wail2ban".

For further customization or integration, review and modify the `wail2ban.ps1` script as needed.
